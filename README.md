3. Download the files to a local directory. 
4. Use a command/terminal to select the directory folder.
5. Run the following command 'npm install' to download the required module.

## How To Use

To use the app is very simple, when you run the file it will ask you to input the name of the south african city that you are looking for and if located will output the population, elevation, latitude, longitude and temperature. If there was an error locating the city it will let you know.
