1. You will need to create an account at rapidapi.com and sign-up (for free) for the geodb-cities api [found here.](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/).
2. Sign up for the Weather api (again for free) [found here.](https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/weather/).
3. Download the files to a local directory. 
4. Use a command/terminal to select the directory folder.
5. Run the following command 'npm install' to download the required module.
6. Then once the module have been downloaded find the apiPassword variable near the top of the cityDetails.js file and insert the password given by the rapidapi.com when you registered for the apis.

## How To Use

To use the app is very simple, when you run the file it will ask you to input the name of the south african city that you are looking for and if located will output the population, elevation, latitude, longitude and temperature. If there was an error locating the city it will let you know.
